A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

We've been moving into a new apartment over the last couple of days, so the regular computer is still boxed and life is a little chaotic. That's pretty much the whole story behind this all-caps font, assembled from a folder of doodles and experiments that I dip into on just such an occasion. It's a messy-souvlaki kind of font.
